# Task: AI-Based Transaction Classification System

## Objective:
Develop an AI-driven transaction classification system that automatically categorizes financial transactions into predefined groups (e.g., utilities, groceries, healthcare, etc.) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

Gather transaction data from banking statements, payment APIs, or financial datasets.
Example transaction descriptions:

  - __"Walmart Purchase $55.12 - Groceries"__ 
- __"XYZ Electric Bill Payment - $120"__ 
-  __"Doctor Appointment Payment - $75"__
  
  You can use dataset from Kaggle or any other platform.

## Tech Stack
✅ Python (Main programming language)

✅ NLP Libraries: SpaCy, NLTK

✅ Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch

✅ Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Google sheets for test (for storing transactions)

## Expected Output Example

__Input:__ "Uber Ride Payment - $20"

__Predicted Category:__ Transport

__Input:__ "XYZ Pharmacy - $30"

__Predicted Category:__ Healthcare
